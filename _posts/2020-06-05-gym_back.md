# Back to the Gym!

As the easing of lockdowns continues, it is time for me to report how my return to the gym has been going. The first week back was about as well as I could have hoped; most of my strength was there and my ability to do the lifts hasn't dimished too much. The downside is that my legs aren't anywhere near where I would like them to be. Based on others I have talked to, along with the random folks on Twitter, this is not an unusual occurance.

Starting this coming week, I will start publishing thoughts on various papers I have read since my last post along with any courses I have taken. My plan is start also implementing papers that I have read, along with some of the machine learning textbooks that I have read.
