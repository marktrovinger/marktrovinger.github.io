# #SummerofRL

I have been thinking about having a unifying theme for my work this summer in machine learning, and I decided that I would focus on Reinforcement Learning for the summer. This made sense to me, as I have taken an excellent RL course which I reviewed already, and it gave me a good idea for a medium term project as well. So here are the tasks I will be working on this #SummerofRL:

## Papers

My plan is in part to read and review a number of papers relating to RL. I have read several during Phil Tabor's course and my plan is both review them and read more. I don't have a specific number of papers I want to read, but if I find a list of necessary papers in the field I will discuss that list.

## Mini Projects

Part of learning a new thing for me is the implementation of that new thing. While I have done several small projects during Phil Tabor's course, my goal is to design and implement several smaller scale projects over the course of the summer and fall. These may be papers, but they don't have to be. My initial throught would be to see how well my previously implemented algorithms compare in other environments.

## Project

The main project for the summer will be attempting to create an agent that can play the single player mission E1M1 from Doom (the one that came out in 1993). Part of this process will involve creating an environment along with an agent that can sucessfully navigate this environment. Wish me luck!
