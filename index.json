I also felt like it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a great way to demonstrate projects I was working on.\nAs you can see from the site as it sits right now, I have numerous small updates that need to be made, such as updating all of the cards that discuss what my research and career interests are.\n","date":1607904000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607904000,"objectID":"5bc133fcd0f03e16c8fa510eee63f5cb","permalink":"https://marktrovinger.github.io/post/movetohugo/","publishdate":"2020-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/movetohugo/","section":"post","summary":"Why I moved to site to Hugo","tags":["blogging","academia","Hugo"],"title":"Move to Hugo","type":"post"}]
