      <title>Move to Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that my site looks very different than it used to. I decided to move both my site and blog over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, partly due to my dissatisfaction with my old blogging software and my desire to make a more
professional looking site as I get ready to start graduate school in Fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my dissatisfaction with the old setup, which used the fastai template, is it felt very fragile; I constantly felt like I was going to break something with no hope of being able to get it back. I also felt like it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great way to demonstrate projects I was working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the site as it sits right now, I have numerous small updates that need to be made, such as updating all of the cards that discuss what my research and career interests are.&lt;/p&gt;
